# Data Science Portfolio 
Bruno C. da Silva
This repository containing a data science project, presented in the form of jupyter Notebooks, completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes.

## Projects

- Machine Learning

    - [Supervised Learning (Classification):](https://github.com/brcesar/Portfolio/tree/master/Supervised%20Learning%20:%20Classification%20-%20Credit%20Card%20Risk%20Evaluation) Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model to detect the clients that will not be able to pay their credit card bill. The goal is to predict if the client will default or not.

*Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy, Imblearn, Pickle*


- Micro Projects in pyhton

  - Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Analysis:
