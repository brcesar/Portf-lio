# Data Science Portfolio 
*Bruno C. da Silva*

This repository contains data science projects, presented in the form of jupyter notebooks, completed by me for self learning and hobby purposes, and also to show a little about my to show a little bit about my data science skills, using mainly python.

This repository is currently under construction. See you soon with more projects.<br/>


## Projects

- Machine Learning

    - [Supervised Learning (Classification):](https://github.com/brcesar/Portfolio/tree/master/Supervised%20Learning%20:%20Classification%20-%20Credit%20Card%20Risk%20Evaluation) Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model to detect the clients that will not be able to pay their credit card bill. The goal is to predict if the client will default or not.

*Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy, Imblearn, Pickle*


- Micro Projects in pyhton

  - Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Analysis:
  
 ## About me
 
I am physicist by background who enjoys working with modelling. I am very interested in Data Science, focusing on the results that the models can provide to improve the business achievements and deliver the best guidance, data solutions and insights.
